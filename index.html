<p>###Scope and Goal</p>

<p>With the progress of automated driving technologies, self-driving cars are already running safely on highways and freeways. However, besides other limitations, the lack of safe and smooth interactions with pedestrians becomes significant obstacles preventing fully autonomous vehicles in city streets. Protections of vulnerable road users like pedestrians are always of the highest priority in traffic safety, and crashes with pedestrians will significantly impact the trust and public attitudes towards the new mobility technology. Disruptive interactions with pedestrians may also lower both the riding experiences and moving efficiency in the pedestrian-rich road environments. With these issues, it is vital to equip autonomous vehicles with the capabilities to understand pedestrians and make motion planning based on the predictions of their behaviors.</p>

<p>Learning-based pedestrian detection and tracking algorithms have achieved significant improvements in the past several years, allowing vehicle perception systems to accurately calculate pedestrians’ motions through sensor-fusion, predict potential crashes, and make motion-planning decisions accordingly. However, these safety-oriented solutions are not enough for longer-duration predictions of pedestrians’ movements and thus are not ideal for motion planning and cannot support vehicle-pedestrian communications. Many research efforts have been put into recognizing pedestrians’ behaviors and predicting their trajectories in the past few years. Compared with detection and tracking, the prediction of pedestrians’ behaviors is way further from mature and needs more progress to support fully autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p>This Workshop will be the first one focusing on the detection, recognition, and prediction of pedestrian behaviors. The goal is to build a platform for sharing state-of-the-art models, algorithms, and datasets in the field and identifying research needs and directions.</p>
